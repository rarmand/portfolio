          My name is <b>Aleksandra</b> (Ola for short).
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm a <b>frontend developer with 2+ years</b> of professional
          experience and a graduate of AGH University of Science and Technology
          in Krakow, Poland.
        </p>

        <p>
          I build responsive websites with a strong focus on clean code, modern
          design and thoughtful user experience. I love turning ideas into a
          live project and presenting the unique value of a product.
        </p>

        <p>
          I work with a React library, JavaScript and TypeScript, HTML5 and Sass
          - "CSS with superpowers".
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy learning new technologies and broadening my knowledge across
          the web development field. I am fascinated by the cybersecurity
          concepts and how they can be applied to protect digital assets.
